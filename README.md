Expensify App allows users to keep track of their expenses. The users can log into the app with their Google account to get an overview of all their expenses, add new expenses, or edit and delete existing ones. Expenses can be sorted by amount or by date. It is also possible to filter expenses by title or by date; the user will always be presented with information about the number of expenses currently shown on the screen as well as the number of expenses that have been filtered out. This app uses Firebase to handle its database and authentication; routing is handled via React Router and state management is handled via Redux. Testing was done using Jest and Enzyme.
